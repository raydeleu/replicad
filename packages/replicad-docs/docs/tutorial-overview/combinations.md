It is now time to introduce a way to combine shapes together, the main
operations of constructive geometry, also known as the boolean operations.

We will play with two shapes, a box and a cylinder.

## Pasting shapes together

This is what we call the fuse operation:

```js withWorkbench
const { drawRoundedRectangle, drawCircle } = replicad;
const main = () => {
  const cylinder = drawCircle(20).sketchOnPlane().extrude(50);
  const box = drawRoundedRectangle(60, 90).sketchOnPlane().extrude(25);

  return box.fuse(cylinder);
};
```

## Cutting one shape with another

This is what we call the cut operation:

```js withWorkbench
const { drawRoundedRectangle, drawCircle } = replicad;
const main = () => {
  const cylinder = drawCircle(20).sketchOnPlane().extrude(50);
  const box = drawRoundedRectangle(60, 90).sketchOnPlane().extrude(25);

  return box.cut(cylinder);
};
```

## Intersecting two shapes

For the intersection we will intersect the cylinder with itself. This creates
a fun shape:

```js withWorkbench
const { drawRoundedRectangle, drawCircle } = replicad;
const main = () => {
  const cylinder = drawCircle(20).sketchOnPlane().extrude(50);
  const sideCylinder = cylinder.clone().rotate(90, [0, 0, 20], [1, 0, 0]);

  return sideCylinder.intersect(cylinder);
};
```
