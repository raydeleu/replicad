title: Why recipes?

There are some operations using replicad (or any CAD tool) that are at the same
time very common - but have many different configurations and edge cases.

In tools with a UI, this translates to very complex configuration boxes with
multiple options that do not work well together most of the time.

In a code CAD tool like replicad, this would translate to a function with a very
complex signature.

In some cases - the basic logic behind this functionality is fairly simple
â€“ but the different tweaks possible add the complexity.

Instead of offering these as a standard library with a complex interface,
I propose a recipe book of code that can be easily copied and tweaked to your
particular needs.
